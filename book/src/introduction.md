# Bones

Bones is a work-in-progress, opinionated game framework built on [Bevy].

Bone is under development for use in the [Jumpy] game, and possibly other [Fish Folk][fishfolk] games.

The book and libraries are brand new and under development, so there's not much to see yet.

The Bones framework will continue to develop out of the needs of Jumpy and any other games we try to
use it with, with the hope of making it easier to develop 2D pixel games for 2-4 players.
