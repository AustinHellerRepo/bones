# Bones

A work-in-progress, opinionated game meta-engine built on [Bevy].

Under development for future use in the [Jumpy] game, and possibly other FishFolk games.

This repository contains the bones library crates, as well as some other utility crates that may
live elsewhere in the future, but for now are easiest kept here until we find them a good long-term
home, or otherwise decide we don't need them anymore.
